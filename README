Swan Test Suite
Swan - a Cilk extension with dataflow dependencies for task-parallel programs

This file provides basic instructions to setup Swan and provides two test
cases for functional correctness.

=========
* SETUP *
=========
The runtime should be obtained from github.com/hvdieren/swan_runtime
This is an extension of the Intel Cilk Plus Runtime.
Please follow the default setup instructions.

The compiler should be obtained from github.com/hvdieren/swan_clang
This is an extension of the Clang/LLVM compiler.
Please follow the default setup instructions.

Note that the Clang/LLVM distribution has its own copy of the Intel Cilk
Plus Runtime. We have however used the external code base as it is more
recent.

=========
* TESTS *
=========
Set paths and environments to point to the clang compiler and runtime libraries
compiled above.

If you have not ran 'make install' and specified to compile clang in
/path/to/obj, you will find the compiler at:

/path/to/obj/bin/clang++

Similarly, the Cilk libraries can be found in:
/path/to/intel-cilkplus-runtime/.libs
and header files in:
/path/to/intel-cilkplus-runtime/include

Now run this command:
% make -DCXX=/path/to/obj/bin/clang++ -DSWANRTDIR=/path/to/intel-cilkplus-runtime test

The test application is run with 1, 2 and 16 threads. In each case, the output
should indicate that the test was successful.



The exgen test case can also be compiled. However, there is no automatic testing
of correctness.
